# Learning TypeScript

## Description

This repository is dedicated to learning TypeScript. It includes examples, exercises, and notes on various TypeScript features and best practices. TypeScript is a powerful, statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances development with static type checking and advanced tooling.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript offers several advantages over plain JavaScript:

- **Static Typing**: Helps catch errors early during development with type annotations and type inference.
- **Enhanced IDE Support**: Provides better autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring capabilities in modern IDEs.
- **Improved Code Quality**: Enforces type safety and helps document your code more clearly, making it easier to understand and maintain.
- **Compatibility**: TypeScript code compiles to JavaScript, allowing it to run anywhere JavaScript runs.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. **Install TypeScript Globally:**

   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

2. **Verify the installation:**
   ```bash
   tsc --version
   ```

## Usage

1. **Create a typescript file:**
   Create a file with a `.ts` extension, for example, `index.ts` and paste the below code:

   ```typescript
   // index.ts
   const greet = (name: string): string => {
     return `Hello, ${name}!`;
   };

   console.log(greet("TypeScript"));
   ```

2. **Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:**
   Use the TypeScript compiler to convert your .ts files into .js files.

   ```bash
   tsc index.ts
   ```

This command generates an index.js file with the compiled JavaScript code.

3. **Run the JavaScript file:**
   Execute the compiled JavaScript using Node.js.

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

This will output:

`Hello, TypeScript!`
